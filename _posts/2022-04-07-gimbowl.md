<div class="side-title"> 00.  OVERVIEW </div>

### I rebranded and redesigned gimbOWL shopping site to appeal to the targeted buyer.

I made a mobile App mock up and prototyping using Figma. Users can use the App to track their investment performance within one App instead of having to switch between different platforms.
